{"name":"OpenLibm","tagline":"A high quality system independent, portable, open source libm implementation","body":"## OpenLibm\r\n\r\nOpenLibm is an effort to have a high quality, portable, standalone\r\nC mathematical library ([`libm`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libm)).\r\nIt can be used standalone in applications and programming language\r\nimplementations. \r\n\r\nThe project was born out of a need to have a good `libm` for the\r\n[Julia programming langage](http://www.julialang.org) that worked\r\nconsistently across compilers and operating systems, and in 32-bit and\r\n64-bit environments.\r\n\r\n### History\r\n\r\nThe OpenLibm code derives from the [FreeBSD\r\nmsun](http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/msun/) implementation,\r\nwhich in turn derives from [FDLIBM\r\n5.3](http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/). As a result, it includes a number\r\nof fixes and updates to FDLIBM that have accumulated over the years in\r\n`msun`, and optimized versions of many functions.\r\n\r\n### Platform support\r\n\r\nOpenLibm builds on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, and with little\r\neffort, should build on FreeBSD as well. It builds with both GCC and\r\nclang. Although largely tested on x86, it also includes experimental\r\nsupport for ARM. The original `msun` also includes support for mips,\r\nsparc64, powerpc, ia64, and alpha. These are present in the OpenLibm\r\nsource tree, but no attempt has been made to build any of these.\r\n\r\n### Build instructions\r\n\r\n1. `make` or `make USEGCC=1` to build with GCC. This is the default on\r\n   Linux and Windows.  \r\n2. `make USECLANG=1` to build with clang. This is the default on OS X.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
